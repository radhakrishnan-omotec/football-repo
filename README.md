Implementation for the Data Analysis Expected Goals project.


A)	Modeling Expected Goals using xG :
Model measures the probability that a shot will result in a goal based on Two parameters/factors:
1) The distance from where the shot was taken
2) The angle with respect to the goal line

The xG model helps us eliminate a portion of the random factors associated with scoring opportunities when we attempt to quantify a team's ability to score goals, which in the end is the ultimate goal of football.
