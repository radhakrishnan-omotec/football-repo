Implementation for the Data Analysis Expected Goals project.


A)	Modeling Expected Goals using xG :
Model measures the probability that a shot will result in a goal based on Two parameters/factors:
* Shot Location: Proximity to the goal and the angle of the shot play a crucial role.
* Type of Shot:  Whether the shot was taken with the left or right foot, etc.
* Game Situation:  Which half the game, first / second.


The xG model helps us eliminate a portion of the random factors associated with scoring opportunities when we attempt to quantify a team's ability to score goals, which in the end is the ultimate goal of football.
